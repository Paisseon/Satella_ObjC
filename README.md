# Satella
A fast and modern IAP hacker for iOS 12-14, also the only open source IAP hack ever!

**Receipts don't work on iOS 14.**

I already know this. Please stop telling me. iOS 14 no longer uses transactionReceipt, now it uses appStoreReceiptURL and idk how to hack that.

I am working on it, but that is not a guarantee that I will succeed. Remember, Paisseon is dumbass. Praise Bernkastel for the miracle of me being able to make Satella work at all \o/
